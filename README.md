**"The app that ups the apps!"**

Deployly is a mock platform built to demonstrate modern CI/CD workflows, with a humorous twist. It showcases DevOps practices using containerization, automated testing, and continuous deployment pipelinesâ€”all while keeping it lighthearted.

## Features

- **Basic HTTPS Content Serving**: It serves HTTPS content... sometimes.
- **Optional Logging**: Logs only when it feels like it.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated builds that sometimes deploy to a mock Kubernetes cluster.
- **Infinite Scalability**: In theory, not in practice.
- **Custom Notifications**: Simulates build and deployment statuses with random emojis.

---

## Tech Stack

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Mock Cluster)
- **Scripting**: Bash/Python for automation
- **Version Control**: Git

## Example Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to the repository.
2. GitHub Actions trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
3. Docker builds a container image... maybe.
4. Kubernetes YAML files are applied to a mock cluster.
5. Notifications simulate build and deploy results (randomly). ðŸŽ‰

## Repository Structure

```
Deployly/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/  # CI/CD pipelines
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile          # Container configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ k8s/                # Kubernetes manifests
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/            # Automation scripts
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # Documentation
```

---

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/deployly.git
   cd deployly
   ```

2. Set up Docker and Kubernetes locally or use mock configurations provided in the `k8s/` directory.

3. Push changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure), maybe.
- Real-time deployment monitoring (if it works).
- Enhanced scalability testing (in our dreams).
