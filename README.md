**"The app that ups the apps!"**

Deployly is a mock platform built to demonstrate Secure CI/CD workflows.

---

## Features

- **Basic HTTPS Content Serving**: It serves HTTPS content... sometimes.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated builds that sometimes deploy to a mock Azure cloud enviorment.
- **Infinite Scalability**: In theory, not in practice.

---

## Tech Stack

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Scripting**: Bash/Python for automation
- **Version Control**: Git

---

## Example Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to the repository.
2. GitHub Actions trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
3. Docker builds a container image... maybe.
4. Kubernetes YAML files are applied to a mock cluster.
5. Notifications simulate build and deploy results (randomly). ðŸŽ‰

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time deployment monitoring (if it works).
- Enhanced scalability testing (in our dreams).
